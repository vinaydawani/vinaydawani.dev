# Project 0 - CS50:Web

A very basic website which fulfils all the requirements of the project. This website is a dummy website which doesn't have my real information except for my picture.

## HTML Pages-

---

### 1. welcome.html

- This page is a basic welcome page which introduces me. It only has 2 line but more can be added with a little tweaking.

### 2. about.html

- This page has a picture and a short write-up about me with basic styling.

### 3. fav.html

- This page has a table which has some favorite things about me. Nothing to specific.

### 4. contact.html

- This page has a heading and buttons which when clicked leads to their respective links.
- right now, the links don't lead to my profile or email but rather the homepages.

## CSS/SCSS-

---

Exclusively SCSS was coded for the project which was then converted to `css/main-style.css` by command-line.

## Notes-

---

- The website is fully responsive and can be viewed on great number of devices without many complications.
- The website leverages bootstrap 4 completely.
- Any content can be added and deleted from the website without many tweaks. Adding stuff in the future will just need 5-10min of work.
- External tools like font awesome were utilized.
